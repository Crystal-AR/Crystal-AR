# Crystal-AR

## About
Crystal-AR was developed at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, in 2016/2017 as a senior thesis project. The project has been open source since the beginning and is under active development.

Crystal-AR aims to tackle three aspects of augmented reality for images and live feed:

1. Detecting corners.
2. Displaying virtual models.
3. Recognizing text (Tesseract OCR) and extracting information from it.
