# Crystal-AR

## About
Crystal-AR was developed at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, in 2016/2017 as a senior thesis project. The project has been open source since the beginning and is under active development.

Crystal-AR aims to tackle two aspects of augmented reality:

1. Displaying virtual models in a live feed.
2. Recognizing and using text found in images/live feed.
